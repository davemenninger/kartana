# Advantage

When making a roll against a "difficulty" target number, some factor may suggest that the character is at an advantage in the particular situation.  If so, the player may roll "with advantage".  Generally, this is means adding an additional die, to those that would normally be rolled, and omitting the worst value from the results.

For example, instead of rolling a single d20 roll two and omit the _worst_* value.  Or, instead of rolling 3d6 roll 4d6 and omit the worst die value.

## Disadvantage

The principle can be reversed when a character is at a disadvantage.  Instead of rolling a single d20 roll two and omit the _best_* value, etc.

\* - best and worst are different in different systems.  sometimes higher rolls are better and sometimes lower rolls are better.
